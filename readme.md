A game made in less than 48 hrs, where you, a student in ZSEII, are tasked to survive daily routines (ordering correct coffee, resisting temptation to put capacitor in the power outlet, etc.). Surviving them grants you points and losing them makes you fail a maturity subject. When you fail at all maturity subjects, you lose.

This game was made using [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io).
